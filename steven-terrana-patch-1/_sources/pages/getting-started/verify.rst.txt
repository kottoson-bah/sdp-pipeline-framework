To verify your configuration of SDP and tenant repository are working, simply open a pull request in one of your application repositories to the master branch and validate that all testing takes place and a deployment to dev happens.

.. note::  Assuming your organization config repo is in the same GitHub organization as your application repositories, a pipeline may be created for it in Jenkins. This is normal, and you can ignore it.
